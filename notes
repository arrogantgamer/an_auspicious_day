 - For the release, make a big "world map" stitched together from screenshots
 - redo the map using unicode character for clarity
 - bug: you can't summon a crystal on the last tile of the screen (because of the dual crystal thing)
 - bug: gravity doesn't work for crossing a collision object
 - bug: the checkpoint rule requires "no sky", verify that all checkpoints work
   - checkpoints ^``, ^`i and ^`y and ^`_ do not work -- they repeat the first text
   - neither does ^`& -- it does not fire
